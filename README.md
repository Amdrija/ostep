# Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces

This is a repository which contains notes and solutions to homeworks from the book "Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces". You can find the book here: [https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/) and I really recommend it for getting to know OSs.
